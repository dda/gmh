## GMH a Google Maps Helper

by dda @ stimulus.hk

This is a small helper library for Google Maps v3 I am developing for my own use.

I am adding a small test html page that shows what GMH can do for you.

v 0.1.16
  Added some functions to infoWindows. You can manipulate some of the style options of the infowindows (like opacity).

v 0.1.15
  Fixed some bugs
  Added the .removeCloseBoxFromInfowindow / .restoreCloseBoxFromInfowindow functions
